Hand gestures are a spontaneous and powerful communication mode for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Recently, the interactive gesture has become widely used and in the future may replace the mouse and/or keyboard with vision-based devices. The main feature of using hand gestures is to interact with the computer as an input unit.The gesture is defined as a form of nonverbal communication or non vocal communication where the body's movement can convey certain messages.
Gestures originated from different parts of the human body, but the most common ones emerge from the hand or face. Gesture provides a new form of interaction that reflects the experience of the user in the actual world. The interaction by the gesture is more natural and does 
not require any hindering or additional hardware.The essential aim of building hand gesture recognition system is to create a natural interaction between human and computer where the recognized gestures can be used for controlling a robot or conveying meaningful information. How to form the resulted hand gestures to be understood and well interpreted by the computer considered as the problem of gesture interaction.
Human computer interaction (HCI) also named Man-Machine Interaction (MMI) refers to the relation between the human and the 10computer or more precisely the machine, and since the machine is insignificant without suitable utilize by the human.
